he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education
"This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter."
in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost metaphysicians
Bertrand Russell

"Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized."
such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned
people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress
Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy

reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another
event-based or "process" ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another
He used the term "experience" very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience

By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete
"quality", "matter", and "form"
These "classical" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world.

it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things

each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago
Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things
The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything
in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves
It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects.
it obscures the importance of relations

His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities.

Whitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another
He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide
by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time

They inhabit Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe, North Asia and Central Asia.
The East Slavs colonised Siberia and Central Asia.

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (or the Gates Foundation, abbreviated as BMGF) is the largest private foundation in the world
The foundation, based in Seattle, Washington
Warren Buffett (then the world's richest person, estimated worth of US$62 billion as of April 16, 2008)
pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares
In July 2013, Buffet announced another donation of his company's Class B, this time in the amount worth $2 billion
In November 2014, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that they are adopting an open access (OA) policy for publications and data
open access (OA) policy for publications and data, "to enable the unrestricted access and reuse of all peer-reviewed published research funded by the foundation
The foundation trust invests undistributed assets
exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment
its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries
These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world
the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility. It subsequently cancelled the review
n March 2006, the foundation announced a US$5 million grant for the International Justice Mission (IJM)
a human rights organization based in Washington, D.C., US to work in the area of sex trafficking.
the grant would allow the IJM to "create a replicable model for combating sex trafficking and slavery
The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WSH) program of the Gates Foundation was launched in mid-2005
and became a full-fledged program under the Global Development Division in early 2010
since 2005 undertaken a wide range of efforts in the WASH sector involving research, experimentation, reflection, advocacy, and field implementation
In 2009, the Foundation decided to refocus its WASH effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor, using non-piped sanitation services
This was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments
Their grant-making focus has been since 2011 on sanitation science and technology ("transformative technologies")
delivery models at scale, urban sanitation markets, building demand for sanitation, measurement and evaluation as well as policy, advocacy and communications
funding now focuses primarily on sanitation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions
In mid 2011, the Foundation announced in its new "Water, Sanitation, Hygiene Strategy Overview"
Improved sanitation in the developing world is a global need
Improved sanitation in the developing world is a global need, but a neglected priority as shown by the data collected
About one billion people have no sanitation facility whatsoever and continue to defecate in gutters, behind bushes or in open water bodies
India is the country with the highest number of people practicing open defecation: around 600 million people
In 2011, the foundation launched a program called "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge
to promote the development of innovations in toilet design to benefit the 2.5 billion people that do not have access to safe and effective sanitation
It was complemented by a program called "Grand Challenges Explorations" (2011 to 2013 with some follow-up grants reaching until 2015)
Both funding schemes explicitly excluded project ideas that relied on centralized sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts
universities in the U.S., Europe, India, China and South Africa, have received grants to develop innovative on-site and off-site waste treatment solutions
The grants were in the order of 400,000 USD for their first phase, followed by typically 1-3 million USD for their second phase
The Reinvent the Toilet Challenge is a long-term research and development effort to develop a hygienic, stand-alone toilet
This challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying
The aim of the "Omni Processor" is to convert excreta (for example fecal sludge) into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients
has decided not to fund abortion"
the emotional and personal debate about abortion is threatening to get in the way of the lifesaving consensus regarding basic family planning
Up to 2013, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $71 million to Planned Parenthood
U.S. Libraries initiative with a goal of "ensuring that if you can get to a public library, you can reach the internet
Only 35% of the world's population has access to the Internet
The foundation has given grants, installed computers and software, and provided training and technical support in partnership with public libraries nationwide
A key aspect of the Gates Foundation's U.S. efforts involves an overhaul of the country's education policies at both the K-12 and college levels
including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to seniority-based layoffs
It spent $373 million on education in 2009.
One of the foundation's goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the United States
One of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster
Reimagining Aid Design and Delivery" grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations
As part of its education-related initiatives, the foundation has funded journalists, think tanks, lobbying organizations and governments
Millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education
critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage
the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly
Teach Plus, which was founded by new teachers and advocates against seniority-based layoffs
they may marginalize researchers who do not support Gates' predetermined policy preferences
Several Gates-backed policies such as small schools, charter schools, and increasing class sizes
but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which manages the endowment assets and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
spend all of [the Trust's] resources within 20 years after Bill's and Melinda's deaths
the proceeds from the Berkshire Hathaway shares he still owns at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years

domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago
cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs
Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place
modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors.
Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally
cocks
cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, and have more exaggerated plumage than females (hens).
in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals.
They seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached.
Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia
By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry
can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling
light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption
with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin.
A bantam
A bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed, or a "true bantam" with no larger counterpart
Bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs
Cockfighting is said to be the world's oldest spectator sport and may have originated in Persia 6,000 years ago.
Cockfighting
fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed.
Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour
large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter.
medium-sized aquatic birds with broad bills, eyes on the side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet.
drakes
larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds
aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses.
Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly
Clay models of ducks found in China dating back to 4000 BC may indicate the domestication of ducks took place there during the Yangshao culture
domestication of the duck took place in the Far East at least 1500 years earlier than in the West
collect wildfowl eggs and put them under a broody hen,
ducks did not appear in agricultural texts in Western Europe until about 810 AD
mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the ancestor of all breeds of domestic duck (with the exception of the Muscovy duck
various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase.
Pekin duck
can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) in 44 days
Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in
The greylag goose (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians at least 3000 years ago

they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids
descended from one of six subspecies of wild turkey
Pre-Aztec tribes in south-central Mexico first domesticated the bird around 800 BC
feathers for robes, blankets, and ceremonial purposes
Pueblo Indians inhabiting the Colorado Plateau in the United States did likewise around 200 BC.
Commercial turkeys are usually reared indoors under controlled conditions
The lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day, or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly
Females achieve slaughter weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19
Mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts
60 million birds in the United States
it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover.
seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates.
modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)
Japanese breeders began to selectively breed for increased egg production.
By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing,
the events of World War II led to the complete loss of quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production
Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year
Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies

roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators.
A squab
rock pigeon (Columba livia)
When they hatch, the squabs are fed by both parents on "pigeon's milk", a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop
a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a breeding season lasting several months
Worldwide, more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry
50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs.
High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production
birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night.
the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry
the birds have access to natural conditions and can exhibit their normal behaviours
birds have access to a fenced yard and poultry house at a higher stocking rate

their legs cannot always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles.
18 weeks to reach similar weights
cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common
some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure
the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds.
Barn systems have been found to have the worst bird welfare.
In many countries, national and regional poultry shows are held where enthusiasts exhibit their birds
birds which are judged on certain phenotypical breed traits as specified by their respective breed standards
Breed standards were drawn up for egg-laying, meat-type, and purely ornamental birds, aiming for uniformity
The idea of poultry exhibition may have originated after cockfighting was made illegal, as a way of maintaining a competitive element in poultry husbandry
Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat in the world, accounting for about 30% of total meat production worldwide
Sixteen billion birds are raised annually
more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units
There are two distinct models of production;
the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which can be traced back to the farm of origin
China producing two thirds of the total, some 1.7 billion birds

Thorough cooking of the product would kill these bacteria,
a risk of cross-contamination from improper handling of the raw product is still present
people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus

English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisians
The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, bishop of the Frisians
Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops
After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands
Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522
the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops
not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht'), but also extended to the northeast
The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht
the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders
The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders
The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress
The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire
the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished
Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht
allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands.
Henry V in 1122
the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy
The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding
Charles V was struggling to exert his power over the citizens of the city, who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops
The heavily fortified castle Vredenburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city
The castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch Revolt
the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule
The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic
towards its dominant province Holland
Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups
temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year); where the French invasion was only stopped west of Utrecht
the centre of Utrecht was struck by a tornado
The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral
In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession
Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world
were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a brutalist style
the shopping mall Hoog Catharijne
In the early 21st century the whole area is being redeveloped
which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary.
smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen
The larger region, including slightly more remote towns such as Woerden and Amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants
Utrecht's cityscape is dominated by the Dom Tower, the tallest belfry in the Netherlands and originally part of the Cathedral of Saint Martin
An ongoing debate is over whether any building in or near the centre of town should surpass the Dom Tower in height (112 m)
the Nieuw Galgenwaard stadium (2007)
the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city
The inner city has largely retained its Medieval structure, and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact
Surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th- and early 20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out
The eastern part of Utrecht remains fairly open
Utrecht Centraal is the main railway station of Utrecht
Utrecht Centraal is a station on the night service, providing 7 days a week an all night service
International InterCityExpress (ICE) services to Germany (and further) through Arnhem call at Utrecht Centraal
local trains to all areas surrounding Utrecht also depart from Utrecht Centraal; and service several smaller stations
Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 33% of journeys within the city are by bicycle
There are also barrow bikes, for carrying shopping or small children
in 2014 to build the world's largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station
Hoog Catharijne
The corridors are treated as public places like streets, and the route between the station and the city centre is open all night
Parts of the city's network of canals, which were filled to create the shopping center and central station area, will be recreated
The Jaarbeurs, one of the largest convention centres in the Netherlands, is located at the west side of the central railway station
The most prominent of these is Utrecht University (est. 1636), the largest university of the Netherlands with 30,449 students
According to Shanghai Jiaotong University's university ranking in 2014 it is the 57th best university in the world
Utrecht city has an active cultural life, and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam
Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival (Festival Oude Muziek, for music before 1800) and the Netherlands Film Festival
The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg
Young musicians are educated in the conservatory, a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts
To promote culture Utrecht city organizes cultural Sundays
thematic Sunday several organisations create a program, which is open to everyone without, or with a very much reduced, admission fee
an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants (Utrechts Centrum voor de Kunsten
Utrecht is home to the premier league (professional) football club FC Utrecht
Utrecht's waterways are used by several rowing clubs
Kampong, the largest (amateur) sportsclub in the Netherlands (4,500 members)
Kampong features fieldhockey, soccer, cricket, tennis, squash and jeu de boules.

hypothesis of pangenesis.
Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable
in the 1930s and 1940s
Neo Darwinian Evolution
often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found
why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?
the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.

any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.
He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps.
He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax
some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others

the Cambrian explosion
South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals
barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions.
His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification.
morphology
the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat

that his theory might produce revolutionary changes

the concept of transmutation of species
his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism.
Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines
John Herschel
its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, and its ability to explain a wide range of observations
Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics
because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay
it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation
its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction.
would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail
no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications
Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science
social reform
Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms
Darwinism
the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague "law of development" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour
natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible.

interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design
Darwin quoted Kingsley as "a celebrated cleric", and added the phrase "by the Creator" to the closing sentence,
some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted
Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature
Baden Powell praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"
defending the book in terms of theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with Natural Theology.
Theistic evolution became a popular compromise
supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation

The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment.

an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids
intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required

There is currently no precise test
pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time
if there is a history of: recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
asthma and COPD
by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi
due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management
corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, and smoking cessation
The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent
none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication
have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended
effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma
World Health Organization
Avoidance of triggers
allergens, smoke (tobacco and other), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods
Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke
decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma
Yoga
For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs
It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies
it appears to decrease the subsequent rate.

that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move
a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car
the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank
travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers
passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart
the system is subject to gaming
The dispatching algorithm
people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators
this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person
every user gets an RFID card to identify himself
the system knows every user call and can cancel the first call if the passenger decides to travel to another destination to prevent empty calls
either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons
moderate incoming traffic
most typically in the morning
people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period
when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time
to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity

qualified elevator mechanics
to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance
a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB
the elevator will come to a stop if moving
The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches
a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building
The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor
the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor
The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset
the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to
Phase-two mode can only be activated by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralized control panel
manually pushes and holds the door close button
enables the car to move
This mode was created for firefighters so that they may rescue people from a burning building
on the COP
it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator
Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button
The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor
will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car
allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated
One by one, each car in the group will return to the lobby floor, open its doors and shut down
People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly
the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service
The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually overridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby
when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors and shut down
emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit
The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch

Spanish colonization in North America that would later become the states of Florida, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and California.
In 1821, after Mexico's War of Independence from Spain, Texas was part of the United Mexican States as the state of Coahuila y Tejas
A large influx of Americans soon followed, originally with the approval of Mexico's president. In 1836
Texans, fought a war of independence from the central government of Mexico
In 1846, the Republic dissolved when Texas entered the United States of America as a state.
Per the 1850 U.S. census, fewer than 16,000 Texans were of Mexican descent, and nearly all were Spanish-speaking people
Through the force of sheer numbers, the English-speaking American settlers entering the Southwest established their language, culture, and law
United States never developed bilingualism as Canada did.
California constitutional convention of 1849 had eight Californio participants; the resulting state constitution was produced in English and Spanish,
the convention's English-speaking participants felt that the state's remaining minority of Spanish-speakers should simply learn English
U.S. federal government strenuously tried to force Puerto Ricans to adopt English

the Salvadoran immigrant population in the United States increased nearly fivefold from 94,000 to 465,000.
the United States continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters
Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States.
Between the 18th and early 19th centuries, there were many European immigrants who went to Venezuela
Many Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a better education, only to remain in there following graduation.
since the early 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary

The state outside the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 was part of the New Mexico Territory until 1863, when the western half was made into the Arizona Territory.
The area of the former Gadsden Purchase contained a majority of Spanish-speakers until the 1940s
Because of its relative isolation from other Spanish-speaking areas over most of its 400-year existence
, New Mexico Spanish, and in particular the Spanish of northern New Mexico and Colorado has retained many elements of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish
has developed its own vocabulary. In addition, it contains many words from Nahuatl, the language spoken by the ancient Aztecs of Mexico.
New Mexican Spanish also contains loan words from the Pueblo languages of the upper Rio Grande Valley, Mexican-Spanish words (mexicanismos)
borrowings from English. Grammatical changes include the loss of the second person verb form, changes in verb endings
In Texas, English is the state's de facto official language

. The Government of Texas, through Section 2054.116 of the Government Code, mandates that state agencies provide information on their websites in Spanish
Spanish is currently the most widely taught non-English language
More than 1.4 million university students were enrolled in language courses
Spanish is the most widely taught language in American colleges and universities with 53 percent of the total number of people enrolled
French (14.4%), German (7.1%), Italian (4.5%), American Sign language (4.3%), Japanese (3.7%), and Chinese (2.4%)

There are 500 Spanish newspapers, 152 magazines, and 205 publishers in the United States; magazine and local television
Calvin Veltman undertook, for the National Center for Education Statistics and for the Hispanic Policy Development Project
the most complete study of English language adoption by Hispanophone immigrants
his study based itself upon a large 1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census (which has not been repeated),
high bilingualism rates and subsequent adoption of English as the preferred language of Hispanics, particularly by the young and the native-born.

the Church holds that Mary was also sinless personally, "free from all sin, original or personal
The Council of Trent
doctrine of the immaculate conception (Mary being conceived free from original sin) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus
Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother

the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East

In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception (passive) of Mary, and was associated particularly with the Normans
Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux, Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.

The question arises for Anglicans, however, as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held
